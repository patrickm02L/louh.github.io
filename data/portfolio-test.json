			"description": "Scotchhollow is an existing 418-unit family apartment community built in the early 1970s, where the owner is seeking to upgrade the development to more modern standards of living to attract a changing demographic on the San Francisco peninsula. Our proposed improvements looked at replacing the existing community center with a larger one that accomodates more amenities, creating more direct paths through the landscape, adding programmatic elements to unactivated lawn areas, orienting the front door of ground floor units towards common areas rather than interior corridors, improving lighting throughout the site, upgrading the look of carports, and adding access points between the community and the park next door."

			"description": "The Sac Catalyst Competition received almost 50 entries worldwide to re-envision the Capitol Mall corridor of downtown Sacramento, an eight block civic boulevard with a wide grassy median but not much pedestrian activity.  Our proposal brings people back to the Mall with three principles in mind: to activate the edges of the mall, frame the view of the Capitol, and to direct visitors down a path from the river to the civic center. A sequence of different pedestrian zones create a procession of views and experiences from natural to higher order. Strategies to activate the space include removing a lane of traffic in each direction, removing curbs, encouraging food trucks and other periodic events, and infilling buildings to create a better street edge. As the city lacks funds to implement large projects, each component of the Promenade plan can be implemented separately until the final space is realized."
