      "description": "One of the main motivations for the City of Las Vegas to pursue a partnership with Code for America is in its effort to dramatically improve the way it does its development services with small businesses that want to locate in the city. During the fellowship year, we decided to focus on a small portion of the development services process, rather than the entire system. We created the Las Vegas Development Fastpass to improve the experience of a customer navigating through complicated city processes, to reduce the amount of barriers that stymied small business development in the city, and to encourage sharing of data between departments, and to reduce interdepartmental miscommunication. The application attempts to match a prospective business owner with the best location to start their business in Las Vegas, based on how well their business matches with zoning and potentially any number of existing conditions on the property. Once a property is selected, the user has all the information to proceed with the next steps of the development permitting and review process.",

Started as a side project by Code for America fellows, we decided to keep the visuals and interactions fun and friendly, inspiring civic participation without requiring a background in urban planning, and allows citizens to engage with city government in an unprecedented manner. Citizens can learn about street design and make their own decisions and tradeoffs, resulting in better feedback. Planners can collect these ideas and analyze them for trends and priorities, so that all contributions are treated fairly. Ultimately, by improving communication, education, and data gathering, we’ll compress the feedback loop between city planners and the community and make better public spaces a reality in a shorter amount of time.",

The City also implemented a new electronic parking meter system throughout downtown which could monitor the scheduling and enforcement of food truck parking. We saw an opportunity to produce an application that exposed this real-time information to the broader public and publish when food trucks actually appear. This is the first food truck map application that relies on real-time truck locations, is mobile-friendly, and comes with an administration system that allows the City to manage its schedules. The application went live on August 1, 2013, for an initial six month pilot, and the program has been deemed a success with new phases and locations planned for the future.",

      "description": "When Las Vegas was incorporated in the mid-1900s, property owners were able to opt-out, so the boundaries are convoluted and complex, and many holes exist throughout. Yet the United States Post Office allows properties in unincorporated Clark County to use Las Vegas in their mailing address, which results in confusion when citizens request services from the City only to discover that they aren’t covered. Upon learning this, we decided we could quickly create an “Am I In Las Vegas?” application. Our solution differs from existing tools on the City website which are buried in obscure locations or require some programming knowledge. It is a visual interface, works on mobile, and can use a current location or an address input, so that any user can easily see if they are either currently in Las Vegas, or any property that they are interested in.",

      "description": "The Sac Catalyst Competition received almost 50 entries worldwide to re-envision the Capitol Mall corridor of downtown Sacramento, an eight block civic boulevard with a wide grassy median but not much pedestrian activity.  Our proposal brings people back to the Mall with three principles in mind: to activate the edges of the mall, frame the view of the Capitol, and to direct visitors down a path from the river to the civic center. A sequence of different pedestrian zones create a procession of views and experiences from natural to higher order. Strategies to activate the space include removing a lane of traffic in each direction, removing curbs, encouraging food trucks and other periodic events, and infilling buildings to create a better street edge. As the city lacks funds to implement large projects, each component of the Promenade plan can be implemented separately until the final space is realized."
